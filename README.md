# AI Image Detection: Unmasking Real vs. AI-Generated

## Overview

This repository contains the final project for the Machine Learning course (Spring 2023), focused on image classification and clustering. The project involves extracting features from a dataset of 1711 real images and 1711 fake images generated by an AI image generator. The extracted features are then used for both classification and clustering tasks.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset:** The dataset consists of 1711 real images and 1711 fake images. The real images represent genuine images, while the fake images are generated using an AI image generator.

- **Feature Extraction:** Feature extraction techniques were applied to the images to capture various aspects such as color, texture, and edges. The project utilized a combination of techniques including HSV and LAB color space analysis, texture analysis using Local Binary Patterns (LBP), and edge detection.

- **Classification:** The extracted features were used to train machine learning models for image classification. Different classification algorithms were explored, and their performance was evaluated in distinguishing between real and fake images.

- **Clustering:** Clustering techniques were employed to group similar images based on their extracted features. The project explored different clustering algorithms and assessed their effectiveness in segregating real and fake images.

- **Python and Libraries:** The project was implemented in Python and utilized libraries such as CV2, scikit-learn, and matplotlib for image processing, machine learning, and visualization.
